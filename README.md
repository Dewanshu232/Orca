1. Understanding of Current AI Trends

A significant AI development this past year is the release of GPT-4. This advanced language model greatly improves AI's ability to understand and generate human-like text, enhancing applications in customer service, content creation, and education.
For example, AI tutors powered by GPT-4 offer personalized learning, providing real-time assistance tailored to students' needs. In my experience, using a GPT-4-based coding assistant has streamlined my work by quickly identifying errors and suggesting improvements.
